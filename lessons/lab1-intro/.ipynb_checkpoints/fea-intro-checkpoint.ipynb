    "\n",
    "### Solution Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic algorithm for a finite element solution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Decompose the elements into structures and write a governing equation relationship (such as force-displacement) for each element.\n",
    "1.  Assemble all of the elements to get the governing equation statement for the entire problem, $\\underline{\\underline{K}} \\underline{c} = \\underline{F}$.\n",
    "1.  Apply the boundary conditions, $\\underline{\\underline{K}}^{*} \\underline{c} = \\underline{F}^{*}$.\n",
    "1.  Solve the resulting linear system to get the solution $\\underline{c}$.\n",
    "1.  Post-process this result to extract stress, strain, displacement, and other variables of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we proceed a bit differently, but it is easier to see where the foregoing steps arise if you have an understanding of the four basic forms of the problem:  strong $\\mathbb{S}$, weak $\\mathbb{W}$, Galerkin $\\mathbb{G}$, and matrix $\\mathbb{M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\mathbb{S}$ Strong Form\n",
    "\n",
    "The strong form is the canonical mathematical statement of the boundary-value problem which you are accustomed to from your previous engineering studies.  The governing equations are stated for the domain, along with boundary conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### $\\mathbb{W}$ Weak Form\n",

    "\n",
