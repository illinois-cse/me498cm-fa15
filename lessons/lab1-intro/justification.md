#   A Justification

When we open ANSYS Workbench, what we see is a collection of 

Mechanical APDL is:

-   Old looking and visually clunky.
-   Quirky, but powerful.
-   The only thing “real” analyst use.
-   Scriptable, Scriptable and More Scriptable. 


ANSYS Mechanical is:

-   Cool, slick looking user interface
-   Super easy to use when your analysis is supported out-of-the-box.
-   Great meshing and geometry support.
-   Not scriptable.
