# Finite Element Modeling with ANSYS

##  Course Overview

<blockquote>
︎❖ *Objective*:  Understand course expectations and policies.
</blockquote>

-   Introduce yourself and the class prospectus and format.
    
    The format of this class is somewhat experimental.  If I do this right, this will be quite unlike any other class you have ever taken, unless you're also in Andy Ferguson's 498 course on computational materials science.
    
    Since this is a tools course, we will spend most of our time working on lab exercises.  There will be some exposition of principles like element types and postprocessing concepts, but most of our effort will be spent in tutorials.  Four exercises will be assigned, and there will be no examinations.

##  Working with the Computer

<blockquote>
An FEA program allows an engineer to make mistakes at a rapid rate of speed.  (R. Miller)
</blockquote>

This is important, because a popular tenet of current design thought suggests that you should fail often and fail cheaply—in other words, bring your model in contact with reality as often as you can sustain in order to exploit the corrections that come from that contact.

To a certain extent, I want you to treat everything I suggest in this class as a set of guidelines which can be explored and challenged.  Think of the computational environment as itself empirical—it is often easy for you to test small hypotheses and craft working problems which can be compared to each other and to reality.  Many questions in the course may thus be answered by the rejoinder—*do it!*

Let's explore, for instance, constraints on a set of arbitrary keypoints to see what works and what doesn't.  (To be clear, we are now talking about *mathematical* constraints; we'll cover physical constraints later.)
