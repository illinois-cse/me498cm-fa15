    "1.  Assemble all of the elements to get the governing equation statement for the entire problem, $\\underline{\\underline{K}} \\underline{c} = \\underline{F}$.\n",

    "1.  Post-process this result to extract stress, strain, displacement, and other variables of interest.\n",

    "Mathematically, we proceed a bit differently, but it is easier to see where the foregoing steps arise if you have an understanding of the four basic forms of the problem:  strong $\\mathbb{S}$, weak $\\mathbb{W}$, Galerkin $\\mathbb{G}$, and matrix $\\mathbb{M}$.\n",
